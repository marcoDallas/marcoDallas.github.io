This made me using almost all the time windows, where I have an optimal power management.\r\nI've tried lot of ways to resolve this problem, and finally i found it in acpi_call. With this kernel module I could deactivate the discrete gpu of my laptop, so battery life and temperature began to be similiar to windows. But the installation and usage of this kernel module is not very user friendly for a beginner, so i decided to made it more simple.\r\n\r\nI've created for it a graphic interface and some automatization scripts, you can find these projects here:\r\n * [acpi_call_GUI : ubuntu and debian based distros version](https://github.com/marcoDallas/acpi_call_GUI)\r\n * [acpi_call_GUI_Fedora : fedora version](https://github.com/marcoDallas/acpi_call_GUI_Fedora)\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n##Regards from \r\n   _Marco_\r\n    ","google":"Marco Dalla Libera acpi_call_GUI acpi_call_GUI_Fedora","note":"Don't delete this file!
